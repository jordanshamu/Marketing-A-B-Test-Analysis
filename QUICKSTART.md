## 💡 Pro Tips

### Speed Up Your Work
1. **Don't overthink cell outputs** - If a visualization looks good, move on
2. **Use the templates** - Fill in blanks rather than writing from scratch
3. **Focus on insights** - Spend more time on interpretation than code
4. **Batch your work** - Run multiple cells at once when possible

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. ❌ Spending too long on data cleaning (data is already clean!)
2. ❌ Creating too many variations of the same plot
3. ❌ Writing overly technical explanations
4. ❌ Forgetting to save visualizations
5. ❌ Not filling in the markdown sections

### What Recruiters Look For
1. ✅ **Clear business impact** - Always tie findings to dollars/conversions
2. ✅ **Statistical rigor** - Show you understand the tests
3. ✅ **Visualization quality** - Clean, professional charts
4. ✅ **Communication** - Can you explain this to a non-technical audience?
5. ✅ **Code quality** - Well-organized, commented, reproducible
